# Hanoi Lab Notes

## The Towers of Hanoi Problem
* You have pegs and a disks of different sizes, any disk can slide onto any peg
* Problem starts with all disks being stacked on one peg from bottom to top in increasing order
  * smallest disk on top, largest disk on bottom
* You can only move one disk at a time, you cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk
* Goal is to move the entire stack to another peg
  * the stack should also be in increasing order from bottom to top
